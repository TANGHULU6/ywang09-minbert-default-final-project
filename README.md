# Yuan Wang's CS 224N Default Final Project - Multitask BERT

The files in this project are originally from Stanford CS 224N's starter repository: https://github.com/gpoesia/minbert-default-final-project. The code files are edited to complete this project. The most critical edits are in the the following two files: multitask_classifier.py and construct_datasets.py.

The poster and final report could be found in the /Results folder.
